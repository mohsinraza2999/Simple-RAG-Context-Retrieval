# Simple-RAG-Context-Retrieval
A simple context retrieval RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline involves several steps: data indexing, retrieval, and generation. First, the data is loaded, split into smaller chunks, then embeddings are created for the chunks and stored in a vector database. When a query is received, retrieves the most relevant chunks from the database.
